-- different types of counts ---

-- Count(*) - gives the count of rows in a table even the NULL rows -- 

-- Count(1) - same as count(*) , it is counting literal constant value n no times , we can have any literal value
-- count(100) - it is also same
-- count(column_name) -- in this NULL will be excluded 
-- we don't have to use group by and distinct in 1 statement , as both calculate distinct value
